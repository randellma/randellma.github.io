I decided that my old from-scratch portfolio site needed some uplifting and this blog is the result. 

I wanted a place to document some of my interests, side-projects, and learnings but my old site was not up for the task. Though... I could have probably built that functionality into the existing site in the time it took me to choose a worthy blogging platform.

I also wanted to refresh the look:

While my old design wasn't _awful_, I am comfortable enough with myself at this point in my career to admit that am not a graphics designer and probably never will be. And there's something elegant about choosing a tool to do a job rather than trying to re-invent the wheel from scratch like my old site was doing. So I eventually landed on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate things combined with [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/) - one of the many great themes you can choose from.

Anyway - onward and upward. I've got a few ideas for posts that I already want to tackle and am excited to get them in writing.

Hopefully see you all again soon!
