I am obsessed with software engineering - I love everything about it. From the satisfying way an elegant design comes together to the pride in seeing what you’ve help build running in production improving peoples lives. No other profession could give me such challenge, satisfaction, and endless possibilities to continue to learn.

And I almost entirely missed out on it all! In the 10th grade I had to choose between a computer hardware course and a computer software course - I chose the hardware course. It focused on PC components and administration mostly. But there was one section where we did some Visual Basic forms programming that made me realize what I was missing.

At this point I was in the 12th grade, though. And I had missed the 10th and 11th grade software prerequeisites. But as luck would have it, I had a gap in my schedule that year and I got permission to take the software course to fill my schedule. I thought “hey, it’s okay if I completely fail because I don’t need this course to graduate anyway”.

Even still, I was still terrified that I’d be completely behind everyone else. So I was determined to learn as much as I could on my own before the course started. This was my first experience ever learning something because I wanted to learn it and not because I had a test the next day. And when the course finally started I was shocked to see that, if anything, I was ahead of where the 11th grade courses left off. It turned out to be favourite high school course, and I knew that I was going to apply for either software engineering or computer science programs in university.

And that’s exactly what I did! Fast forward to today and I’m extremely thankful that I was lucky enough to fill that empty slot in my schedule all those years ago because it’s led me down the path to the career of my dreams. Where every day I can solve interesting problems, work with incredible people, and continually grow my skills to carve out new and interesting opportunities.
